# Routes Explained

So there's 3 main routes: cheating, vegas, and ntr.

#### BF Perspective

BF feels insecure, even though he's engaged to GF, she seldom initates sex unless it's as a 'reward' (like agreeing to go on vacation during the prologue).  He secretly wishes she had more of a sexual appetite and often fantases about her with other men.

GF is only 22 and while she wants to marry BF, she regrets not 'playing the field' more before settling down.  She remembers her encounters with M1 during college, and she liked when he took control, often using her for sex at parties.  She liked being his fuck toy.

If he suspects she's cheating, he'll be worried, but aroused.  She'll assure him she loves him and wants to marry him, and his fantasies will intensify.  The 'events' between GF and the other males can then be shown as dreams or fantasies, instead of 'known facts'.  The player will be given the opportunity to 'gather evidence', either by checking up on her or looking for physical evidence (used condoms, sticky underwear, asking F1/F2, etc).  (If the GF-BF relationship score is > 0)

If the GF-BF relationship score is < 0 however, she'll be less careful about hiding it, or denying it, and MC can choose to have a confrontation.  This should happen at night in their cabin, any time after she's given oral sex to another male.

At this point our flags are: oblivious > suspects > has proof > can confront

If the BF-GF relationship score is < 0, he can choose to encourage her.  Things like suggesting she go without panties, or purposly causing/allowing situations where her and the male she likes the most are alone.  He can then choose to watch her (she likes this), or she can tell him about it later when they're in bed.  The epilogue for this route is they're happily married and occasionally swing/swap/hotwife with other males or couples.

If the BF-GF relationship score is > 0, then he can't encourage her, but he's still aroused by it.  She's going to go on 'dates', she might encourage him to watch (under the bed, through the window, etc), but it's not abusive (he satisfies me like you *never* can kind of thing).  She'll work to convince him that it's ok if she has some fun before they are married and that she still loves him.  The epilogue for this route is they're married, though she still goes on 'dates' while he's out of town and ends up pregnant and he's not sure if the child is his.

At this point our flags are: vegas or ntr

If they make it through 14 days with MC suspecting or having proof that she's cheating, but has chosen not to confront her, the epilogue is the unhappily married one, and they'll have a baby that sort of looks like the BF but he's unsure.

#### GF Perspective

If the BF is cheating, it's from the MC's perspective and I don't really want to deal with GF choosing to confront him.  She might give him the odd dirty look or make a snide comment, or sleep facing away from him in bed at night.  If the MC doesn't reach the 'has proof' step, then the epilogue is they're unhappily married and fight often and he's banging his secretary who gets pregnant, GF divoces him.

If BF is not cheating on GF, he'll still get to have sex with GF.  If the player has chosen the vegas or ntr routes, he will most likely be getting sloppy seconds.

If the BF chooses not to cheat, and never confronts GF, then the epilogue is he dies of boredom at a young age (scene of a funeral with GF in black being comforted on either side by M1 and M2).

As far as BF cheating with F1... F1 is not doing it to hurt GF or ruin their friendship.  F1 is spoiled, she *always* gets what she wants, BF being engaged to GF means he's *off the market*.  F1 will flirt with BF and the player will have the choice of rejecting or accepting her advances.  If the player chooses rejection, this frustrates her, because even though she was not originally interested in him she's not used to being rejected, so she feels a strong urge to corrupt him, adding him to her list of conquests.  It's somewhat of a reverse play, if she flirts with you and you reject her, that will increase the BF-F1 score and she'll try harder next time.  If you don't reject her, she thinks you're a fool and the BF-F1 score goes down to the point where when future activities are decided, and we check for who BF likes more, F1 or F2, F1 will never be chosen.

#### Example Events

Here's an example early event, before enough events have happened to trigger vegas/ntr:

- the group is running low on beer
- m3 comes into town with the truck, and says they can use it to pick some up in the village
- the player can choose whether he or GF should go to town
- if the player chooses GF should go:
    - we switch control of the player to GF
    - the male she likes the most (M1 or M2, defaults to M1 if they're both tied) will go with her
    - on the drive to town, male flirts with GF and she can choose to reject or accept his advances (increases the GF-male score)
    - in town they get lunch/drinks and buy supplies
    - on the way back, if GF-male's score is > GF-BF, she can choose to initiate an event

- if he chooses to go himself:
    - the female he likes the most (F1 or F2, defaults to F2) wants to go as well
    - they drive to town, on the way he has the choice to flirt with her (increases the BF-girl score)
    - in town, or on the way back, if the BF-girl score is *higher* than the BF-gf score, he is given a choice to kiss her
    - they arrive back in town at dusk, and have dinner/drinks and a game with the group


Here's an example later event, say on day 7:

- the group needs to gather more firewood for the bonfire
- the boys found an axe the other day in one of the storage crates
- the male GF likes the most volunteers to go gather more
- the player can choose who goes to gather firewood
- if player chooses M1/M2 should go:

    - GF volunteers to help him by gathering twigs and dried leaves for the fire
    - if the vegas flag is set:
        - bf gives gf a wink and suggests she have some fun with him
        - the couple is gone for hours, BF goes to bed, GF comes home a short while later and he wakes up, BF asks how it went and she replays the scene for him while she's sucking him/he's eating her/they're having sex

    - if the ntr flag is set:
        - gf gives bf a wink as walks into the forest with M1/M2, his hand on her ass
        - later that night in bed, GF comes in late and will volunteer the information "sorry we took so long earlier, you must have been so worried!  we just started fooling around and you know... we got a little carried away and I let him cum inside me"

    - if the suspects or has proof flags are set, BF will have the choice to get worried and go to look for them (optionally he can choose to spend his time with F1 or F2)
        - if he already has proof but hasn't confronted her, he finds them having sex and watches from the bushes
        - if he suspected, he finds them making out and now has proof, but the couple starts the head back before anything happens
        - he rushes back to bed and pretends to be asleep when GF comes in, end of day

    - if he's oblivious or he chooses not to go check on them, then he just goes about his day, swimming or doing something else with the remaining male, or finding time alone with F1/F2
        - the couple comes back from the woods and they play a game or sit around the bonfire, maybe playing Truth or Dare

- or the player can choose to go himself
    - F1 or F2 (whoever he has a higher score with) offers to go help
    - has has an event with F1 or F2 in the woods
    - come back to find they took too long and everyone went to bed
    - gf is asleep when he crawls into bed

#### Note

For both the vegas / ntr events with the GF, player control is switched to the female for things like choosing positions / responses / where the cum ends up.  If the sex scene is 10 pictures, we might show 7 of them during the event and save 3 for the recounting to BF later on.
